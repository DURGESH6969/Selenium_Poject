## Overview

Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers and is widely used for testing web applications. In this project, i have used Selenium WebDriver to test various basic web components such as forms, buttons, input fields, and more on the [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com) website.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests in this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) installed.
- A compatible web browser (e.g., Chrome) and the corresponding WebDriver installed.
- Internet connectivity for accessing the [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com) website.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DURGESH6969/selenium_project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
 cd selenium_project

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

Tested Web Components
I have tested the following web components on the DemoQA website:

Forms: Testing forms, form elements, and form submission.
Buttons: Testing different button interactions and actions.
Input Fields: Testing text input fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
Alerts and Modals: Handling alerts, pop-ups, and modals.
Please explore the project source code to see the detailed tests for each web component.

## How to Run Tests ##

To run the tests, follow these steps:

Make sure you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.

Update the WebDriver configuration in the Python scripts to match your local WebDriver installation.

Run a specific test script or the entire test suite using Python.

Observe the test results in the terminal and any browser windows that may open.

You can customize and expand the tests as needed for your project.
